# BlockSafe-Decentralized-File-Storage-using-Blockchain-and-IPFS
BlockSafe is a mini-project for my MCA 3rd semester. Itâ€™s a web app that uses Blockchain + IPFS for decentralized file storage. Files are stored on IPFS, while metadata with Proof-of-Work is recorded on blockchain, ensuring security, immutability, and easy upload/download via a simple web UI.

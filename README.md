# BlockSafe-Decentralized-File-Storage-using-Blockchain-and-IPFS
BlockSafe is a mini-project for my MCA 3rd semester. Itâ€™s a web app that uses Blockchain + IPFS for decentralized file storage. Files are stored on IPFS, while metadata with Proof-of-Work is recorded on blockchain, ensuring security, immutability, and easy upload/download via a simple web UI.

# BlockSafe: Decentralized File Storage

BlockSafe is a secure and user-friendly decentralized file storage solution that combines the power of blockchain technology with the distributed nature of IPFS. It ensures that files remain safe, accessible, and verifiable at all times.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Secure File Upload**: Upload files of any type or size through a clean web interface
- **Blockchain Metadata Storage**: File metadata (name, IPFS hash, timestamp) is stored on a custom blockchain
- **Easy File Download**: Download files by entering the IPFS hash; system restores original filename
- **Data Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 hashing ensures file integrity during download
- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored on IPFS network, eliminating single points of failure
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Blockchain ensures metadata cannot be altered

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
